          Paper Cup Recycling Initiative

        <p className="mb-5">
          Welcome to CupCare Initiative, where we&apos;re taking a step towards
          a greener, more sustainable future. Our latest initiative focuses on
          the responsible disposal of used paper cups, aiming to make a positive
          impact on both the environment and the lives of waste collectors in
          our community.
        </p>

          Why Paper Cup Recycling Matters:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-5">
          Did you know that a significant number of paper cups end up in
          landfills every day? By participating in our initiative, you
          contribute to reducing this environmental impact. Paper cup recycling
          not only saves trees but also conserves energy compared to
          manufacturing new cups from raw materials.
        </p>

            Empty the liquid: Visit our collection point at Research Park mess,
            empty the liquid in the dedicated funnel.
          </li>
