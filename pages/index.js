          Welcome to CupCare Initiative, where we&apos;re taking a step towards
          a greener, more sustainable future. Our latest initiative focuses on
          the responsible disposal of used paper cups, aiming to make a positive
          impact on both the environment and the lives of waste collectors in
          our community.

          Why Paper Cup Recycling Matters:
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <div className="font-mono mb-2">
            Did you know that a significant number of paper cups end up in
            landfills every day?
          </div>
          <div>
            By participating in our initiative, you contribute to reducing this
            environmental impact. Paper cup recycling not only saves trees but
            also conserves energy compared to manufacturing new cups from raw
            materials.
